Slides for "Lessons Learned in Teaching Test-Driven Development" are not available.
However, Andy Tinkham believes he based slides and talk on another talk, the one
he gave with Cem Kaner on Agile Conference in 2005.

Sides for THAT talk are available here, in file named
Andy_Tinkham_Cem_Kaner_Agile_2005_Experiences_Teaching_a_Course_in_Programmer_Testing.pdf .
